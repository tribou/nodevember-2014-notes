- 1620 - Slide Rule
- 194x - Human Computers
- 195x - Mainframes
- 197x - PC

### Mathematics

- 263AD - First published algorithm

> Until the 1800s, if you came up with something, you may not be recognized for it.  It was very difficult for ideas to spread globaly.

- 300BC - Binary "numbers"
- 1703 - Formal Binary Logic
- 1937 - Boolean Algebra, meet switching circuits!

### Internet and Communication Tech

- 1860 - Pony Express (only lasted 18 months before going out of business)
- 1837 - Commercial Telegraphy (eastern United States)
- 1858 - Transatlantic Telegraphs
- 1969 - Arpanet
- 1986 - Usenet
- Today - Internet

### Web Programming

- 1989 - Hypertext
- 1995-1998 - The Browser Wars
  - 1995 - HTML 2
  - 1996 - CSS
  - 1997 - ~ECMA~ JavaScript
- 2001-2006 - The Dark Ages

## J. Orendorff's History of JavaScript
*Jason Orendorff*

> JavaScript was famously written in 10 days.

- Libraries (jQuery, etc)
  - Why was there a 10-year gap before this caught on?
  - There was a stigma to JavaScript.  Web developers hated it.
  - 2005 - Google Maps launched, and the stigma ended.
  - 2008 - JavaScript: The Good Parts.

### We Are Here
*Eliza Brock*

- HTML5
- CSS3
- All the tools in the world
- Preparing the fourth generation of programmers
- Things are moving fast
- Things aren't perfect

#### A field of amateurs

##### Siloing
- Enterprise and Open Source
- Industry and Academia
- Ruby and JavaScript

##### Reinventing the wheel
  - OpenSSL guy wrote his own library
  - Why didn't he use the built-in library?
  - He was a security consultant and wanted something more secure
  - Dunning-Kruger Effect
    - People who know nothing are confident
    - The more you start learning, the more you realize you don't know
    - "Business People" misinterpret that initial confidence with expertise
    - "Business People" misinterpret the latter lack of experience with inadequacy
- Blind Optimism (resilience)
- The Farce of Meritocracy
- A certain...sameness?
- So, we have some bugs
- What do we do now?
- Burn the whole place down?
- The sweet allure of green fielding
- Isn't all it's cracked up to be 
  - You end up carrying all the problems with you
  - Netscape tried green fielding to hit the next level
  - They had five years of bugfixes and tests in the old system in addition to technical debt
  - That's how IE won the browser wars
- We can learn from our friends in other fields
  - E.g. what can we learn from engineers? 
    - Safeguards, reviews, etc--our code has consequences
  - What can we learn for the military?
    - Ready, aim, fire--make each shot count
  - What can we learn from business?
    - Gartner height cycle--where should I invest my limited time in technology
  - What can we learn from scientists?
    - The Scientific Method--follow a process towards progress
- We Are and Should Be Standing on the Shoulders of Giants

### Everything Old Is New Again

- Dropbox == Rsync
- IFTTT == AT and Pipes
- Gmail == Email and Mutt
- Twitter == Wall

### Read Old Programs
*Jason Orendorff*

> "I'm always delighted by the light touch and stillness of early programming languages. Not much text; a lot gets done." -Richard Gabriel

- Programming Pearls by Jon Bentley
- Old code has a sense of simplicity

> Read old programs.  We'll all be better off.

### Building on the Wheel
*Eliza Brock*

- There are amazing things that were working in the 50s and 60s that we don't realize
- Bowling ball as a mouse
- 3D CAD design in the 1960s

> "The future is already here--it's just not very evenly distributed." -William Gibson

- De/re-separating content and presentation

### Dip into the Past
*Jason Orendorff*

> "The past is a foreign country: they do things differently there." -L. P. Hartley

- Functional programming--addresses problems that we have now
  - Only took 50 years to catch on


*Eliza Brock*

- The ASP.NET project of doom
  - Built like a desktop application
  - Was not designed to be stateless
  - Passed state around with each request
  - The web is not stateful

### So, What to Learn?

- "Classic" design patterns
  - "Gang of Four"--*Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software*
  - *Code Complete*
- Automated Testing
  - *Test-Driven Development*
  - *Working Effectively with Legacy Code*
    - How can I turn legacy code around without a green field rewrite?
- People Skills (to give to your manager)
  - *Don't Make Me Think*
  - *The Mythical Man-Month*
    - "Why nine women can't make a baby in one month"
- Listen

### We Must Become the Giants

- We know what not to do
- We know who we are
- We have the technology
  - Present and past
- We know what we can do

So, get out there and do it.
